# Transaction Types

All requests must specify what action they require the Gateway to perform, using the action request field. 

## Financial Operations 

### SALE

This will create a new transaction and attempt to seek authorisation for a sale from the Acquirer. A successful authorisation will reserve the funds on the Cardholder’s account until the transaction is settled.

The `captureDelay` field can be used to state whether the transaction should be authorised only and settled at a later date. **For more details on delayed capture, refer to the [delayed capture guide](annexes#captureDelay).

### VERIFY 
This will create a new transaction and attempt to verify that the card account exists with the Acquirer. The transaction will result in no transfer of funds and no hold on any funds on the Cardholder’s account. It cannot be captured and will not be settled. The transaction `amount` must always be zero.

This transaction type is the preferred method for validating that the card account exists and is in good standing; however, it cannot be used to validate that it has sufficient funds.

### PREAUTH
This will create a new transaction and attempt to seek authorisation for a sale from the Acquirer. If authorisation is approved, then it is immediately voided (where possible) so that no funds are reserved on the Cardholder’s account. The transaction will result in no transfer of funds. It cannot be captured and will not be settled.

This transaction type can be used to check whether funds are available and that the account is valid. However, due to the problem highlighted below, it is recommended that Merchants use the VERIFY action when supported by their Acquirer.

:::warning
If the transaction is to be completed then a new authorisation must be sought using the SALE action. If the PREAUTH authorisation could not be successfully voided, then this will result in the funds’ being authorised twice effectively putting two holds on the amount on the Cardholder’s account and thus requiring twice the amount to be available in the Cardholder’s account. It is therefore recommended only to PREAUTH small amounts, such as £1.00 to check mainly account validity.

### REFUND_SALE

This will create a new transaction and attempt to seek authorisation for a refund of a previous SALE from the Acquirer. The transaction will then be captured and settled if and when appropriate. It can only be performed on transactions that have been successfully settled. Up until that point, a CANCEL or partial CAPTURE can be used, to refund or partially refund the original SALE transaction. The previous SALE transaction should be specified using the `xref` field. This may take up to 180 days from the date of the original sale, however different Card Schemes and Acquirers may set shorter time periods.

Partial refunds are allowed by specifying the amount to refund. Any amount must not be greater than the original received amount minus any already refunded amount. Multiple partial refunds may be made while there is still a portion of the originally received amount un-refunded.

The `captureDelay` field can be used to state whether the transaction should be authorised only and settled at a later date. **For more details on delayed capture, refer to the [delayed capture guide](annexes#captureDelay).

### REFUND

This will create a new transaction and attempt to seek authorisation for a refund from the Acquirer. The transaction will then be captured and settled if and when appropriate. This is an independent refund and need not be related to any previous SALE. The amount is therefore not limited by any original received amount.

The `captureDelay` field can be used to state whether the transaction should be authorised only and settled at a later date. **For more details on delayed capture, refer to the [delayed capture guide](annexes#captureDelay).

## Management Operations {#managementOperations}

You can perform a management action on an existing transaction, such as a capture or cancellation, by sending a request with the required action together with the cross reference for the transaction to act on.

### CAPTURE

This will capture an existing transaction, identified using the `xref` request field, making it available for settlement at the next available opportunity. It can only be performed on transactions that have been authorised but not yet captured. An `amount` to capture may be specified but must not exceed the original amount authorised. This may take up to 30 days from the date of authorisation, however different Card Schemes and Acquirers may set shorter time periods.

The original transaction must have been submitted with a captureDelay value that prevented immediate capture and settlement leaving the transaction in an authorised but un-captured state. **For more details on delayed capture, refer to the [delayed capture guide](annexes#captureDelay).

### CANCEL 

This will cancel an existing transaction, identified using the `xref` request field, preventing it from being settled. It can only be performed on transactions, which have been authorised but not yet settled, and it is not reversible. Depending on the Acquirer it may not reverse the authorisation and release any reserved funds on the Cardholder’s account. In such cases authorisation will be left to expire as normal, releasing the reserved funds. This may take up to 30 days from the date of authorisation, however different Card Schemes and Acquirers may set shorter time periods.

### QUERY 

This will query an existing transaction, identified using the `xref` request field, returning the original response. This is a simple transaction lookup action.

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |

| xref | <span class="badge badge--primary">Yes</span> | Reference to a previous transaction. refer to [payment tokenisation](credentialsonfile#paymentTokenisation). |
| amount  | No | The amount to capture or refund. **Mandatory** for partial refunds or partial captures.|
| callbackURL | No | URL which will receive a copy of the transaction result by POST. The URL must be fully qualified and include at least the scheme and host components. Refer to the [callback URL](overview#callbackUrl) docs for details. |

### Transaction Response 

Apart from the fields below, the response will be the same as for a regular financial operation and will contain the details of the existing transaction.

| Name      | Returned | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| responseCode | Always | A numeric code providing the specific outcome. Check `responseMessage` for more details of any error that occurred. Refer to [Response Codes](annexes#responseCodes) for details. |
