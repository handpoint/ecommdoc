# Sample Code

## Request Checking Only

Sometimes, you may wish to submit a request to the Gateway in order for it to be ‘validated only’ and not processed by the simulator or sent to the Acquirer. In these cases, the following flag can be used that will stop the processing after the integrity verification has been performed:

| Name      | Mandatory | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| checkOnly | No | Check the request for syntax and field value errors only. Do not attempt to submit the transaction for honouring by the Merchant’s financial institution.|

If the request is OK, then a responseCode is returned as 0 (Success); otherwise, the code that would have prevented the request from completing is returned.

Note: in these cases, the request is not stored by the Gateway and is not available within the Merchant Management System (MMS).
