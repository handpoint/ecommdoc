# PayPal Transactions

## Background

PayPal is an additional payment method that is available to all Merchants using the Gateway who have a PayPal account.

To use PayPal, you will be supplied with a separate PayPal Merchant Account that can be grouped with your main Merchant Account using the account mapping facility as documented in the [merchant account mapping](annexes#merchantAccountMapping) section. This allows transactions to be sent using your main Merchant Account and then routed automatically to the PayPal Merchant Account in the same mapping group.

It allows you to offer payment via PayPal in addition to normal card payments.

PayPal transactions will appear in the Merchant Management System (MMS) alongside any card payments and can be captured, cancelled and refunded in the same way as card payments.

PayPal transactions can also be used for recurring billing but require you to indicate in the initial transaction that it will be the basis for recurring billing and that a billing agreement will be entered between your Customer and PayPal when they agree to the payment.

PayPal transactions cannot be used for ad-hoc Credentials on File (COF) repeat transactions unless a billing agreement has been set up.

For more information on how to accept PayPal transactions, please contact customer support.

## Benefits

- Provides your customers with the flexibility of paying by using their PayPal account when this is more suitable to them than using a traditional credit or debit card.
- The in-context PayPal Express Checkout helps improve conversion rates with an easier way to pay without customers leaving your website.
- There are no extra costs for adding a PayPal Merchant Account. However, you will still be liable for the PayPal transaction fees.
- The full PayPal transaction information is available and returned as part of the transaction.
- Transactions are controlled within the Merchant Management System (MMS) in the same manner as normal card transactions.

## Limitations

- You will need a PayPal account.
- Recurring transactions are not supported unless as part of a prearranged billing agreement.
- Independent refunds that are not tied to a previous sale transaction are not supported without prior agreement.
- Transactions require a browser in order to display the PayPal Checkout.
- The PayPal Checkout cannot be opened from within a browser IFRAME and so care must be taken to ensure that any PayPal Checkout button is not placed within such an IFRAME.

## Implementation 

If a transaction is sent to the Hosted Integration using a `merchantID` that is part of a routing group containing a PayPal Merchant, then the Hosted Payment Page will display a PayPal payment button that, when clicked, will open the PayPal Checkout and allow the Customer to pay using their PayPal account.

To customise the PayPal Checkout experience, you may send various options in the `payPalCheckoutOptions` field in your initial request.

Additional information available from the PayPal Checkout will be made available in the `checkoutDetails` response field.

## Transaction Lifecycle

PayPal transactions will use the normal Authorise, Capture life cycle as documented in the section [Authorise, Capture and Settlement](annexes#authoriseCaptureSettlement) with the following differences. In addition, the PayPal `paymentAction` option can be included in the `paypalCheckoutOptions` field to alter the normal payment lifecycle further, to allow an Order, Authorise, Capture model or a straight Sale model to be specified.

### Order

If a `paymentAction` with a value of ‘Order’ is sent, then PayPal will store the transaction but delay authorising it until instructed. To instruct PayPal to authorise the transaction, a further management request can be sent to the Gateway with an `action` of ‘AUTHORISE’ and the `xref` of the transaction to authorise. Alternatively, the AUTHORISE command can be selected in the Merchant Management System (MMS). The transaction will be left in the ‘received’ state.

**Processing management requests (AUTHORISE) is not possible with the Hosted payment page integration, it requires a separate Direct Integration.**  

### Authorise

If no `paymentAction` is specified or a `paymentAction` with a value of ‘Authorize’ is sent, then PayPal will authorise the transaction on receipt as per a standard card transaction and you can capture it later if you used the `captureDelay` field. Note that the value uses the PayPal spelling ‘Authorize’, and not the British spelling ‘Authorise’.

For the first three days (by default) of the authorisation, funds are reserved. This is known as the honour period. After the honour period, captures can still be attempted, but may be returned with insufficient funds.

Authorisations have a fixed expiry period of 29 days.

### Sale

If a `paymentAction` with a value of ‘Sale’ is sent, then PayPal will immediately capture the transaction after authorisation. The transaction will be regarded as having been settled and you will not be able to capture it manually and it will not be sent for settlement that evening. The transaction will be left in either the accepted or rejected terminal states depending on whether PayPal accepted or rejected the transaction.

### Capture

Transactions that have been authorised by PayPal and not immediately settled due to a paymentAction of ‘Sale’ will be able to be captured as normal.

Captures are sent to PayPal immediately and the PayPal response and the transaction will be left in either the accepted or rejected terminal state depending on whether PayPal accepted or rejected the capture request.

There is no need to wait for the nightly settlement batch to run as with normal card transactions. This means that it is not possible to change the amount to be captured or cancel the transaction one a capture has been requested.

Note: PayPal allows multiple captures where they sum the individual capture amounts – ie in a different manner from the Gateway’s, where only a single capture operation can be processed.

**Processing management requests (CAPTURE) is not possible with the Hosted payment page integration, it requires a separate Direct Integration.**  

### Refund

PayPal transactions can be refunded in the same way as normal card transactions (requires a separate Direct Integration). However, in the same way as capture requests, these will be sent to PayPal immediately and not batched up to be sent as part of the nightly settlement process. This means that the transaction will be left in either the accepted or rejected terminal state, depending on whether PayPal accepted or rejected the refund request.

Refunds can be made for full or partial amounts, with multiple refunds allowed up to the original authorised amount.

By default, PayPal allows a Merchant up to 60 days from the original authorised transaction date to perform refunds.

**Processing Refunds is not possible with the Hosted payment page integration, it requires a separate Direct Integration.**  

### Cancel

You should cancel any transactions that you do not wish to capture in order to prevent ‘pending’ transactions on the Customer’s PayPal account.

Authorisations should be cancelled when an initial authorisation was created to confirm the validity of funds during checkout, but the goods will not ship for a significant amount of time (>29 days). Cancelling the transaction will mean that you will have to contact the Customer for an alternative payment method.

All transactions must be completed by being captured or cancelled.

**Processing management requests (CANCEL) is not possible with the Hosted payment page integration, it requires a separate Direct Integration.**  

### Pending Payments 

PayPal may put a transaction into a pending state when flagged for additional fraud review. This state is known to PayPal as payment review or IPR.

IPR transactions will be automatically cancelled by the Gateway and treated as referred transactions with a `responseCode` of 2 and a `responseMessage` indicating the reason that the transaction was put into a pending state. Unlike card referred transactions, an authorisation code cannot be obtained from PayPal verbally and then the transaction resent.

## Reference Transactions

PayPal does not allow ad hoc Credentials on File (COF) type repeat or recurring transactions using the xref of a reference transaction unless that transaction has specifically started a PayPal Billing Agreement.

If you want to be able to make future repeat or recurring transactions, then the initial transaction must include the `billingType` and `billingAgreementDescription` options in the `paypalCheckoutOptions` so as to identify this transaction as the start of a recurring billing sequence. **Processing recurring payments is not possible with the Hosted payment page integration, it requires a separate Direct Integration.**  

This will cause the Gateway to request PayPal to set up a Billing Agreement between you and the Customer. In this case, the PayPal Billing Agreement ID will be returned as part of the `checkoutDetails` and displayed on the Merchant Management System (MMS) as part of the payment details, so that you can easily see which PayPal transactions can be used for recurring billing.
