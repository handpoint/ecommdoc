# Hosted Integration

The Hosted Integration method makes it easy to add secure payment processing to your e- commerce business, using our Hosted Payment Pages (HPP). You can use this method if you do not want to collect and store Cardholder data.
The Hosted Integration method works by redirecting the Customer to our Gateway’s Hosted Payment Page, which will collect the Customer’s payment details and process the payment before redirecting the Customer back to a page on your website, letting you know the payment outcome. This allows you the quickest path to integrating with the Gateway.
