# 3D Secure


## Overview 

:::tip
The Gateway supports both 3-D Secure version 1 and version 2 and will use the highest version available. Version 2 is also commonly known as EMV 3-D Secure. 
3DS Version 2 is now enforced across all Europe and it is therefore **MANDATORY** to support it to prevent a high number of declines. 
::: 

3-D Secure authentication is now a **MANDATORY** fraud prevention scheme in Europe that is on all e-commerce card transactions processed by the Gateway, where supported by the Acquirer.

It allows the Cardholder to assign a password to their card that is then verified whenever a transaction is processed through a site that supports the use of the scheme. The addition of password protection allows extra security on transactions that are processed online.

3-D Secure stands for Three Domain Secure. There are 3 parties that are involved in the 3-D Secure process:
- The company from which the purchase is being made.
- The Acquiring Bank (the bank of the company)
- VISA and Mastercard (the card issuers themselves)

The gateway supports EMV 3-D Secure as implemented by Visa, Mastercard and American Express and marketed under the brand names of Visa Secure, Mastercard ID Check and American Express SafeKey. Implementations by JCB (J/Secure) and DCI (ProtectBuy) are not currently supported.

The 3-D Secure preferences can be configured per Merchant Account. These preferences can be overridden per transaction by sending one of the preference fields which hold a comma separated list of the check responses that should be allowed to continue to completion. Responses not in the list will result in the transaction being declined with a `responseCode` of 65803 (3DS_NOT_AUTHENTICATED).

## 3DS Benefits 
- The results are available immediately and returned as part of the transaction.
- The checks can be managed independently allowing you the utmost control over how the results are used.
- The checks can be configured to decline the transaction automatically, where required..
- There are no extra Gateway costs for using 3-D Secure. Your Acquirer may charge to add this onto your business account; however, you may also find that your transaction charges are lower as a result of using 3-D Secure.
- Fully configurable for each merchant account. 

## 3DS Limitations 
- The gateway does not support 3-D Secure for JCB or Diner’s club cards.
- 3-D Secure transactions require a browser in order to display the Customer authentication dialog.

## 3DS Implementation 

If your Merchant Account is set up for 3-D Secure, the Hosted Payment Page will automatically attempt to display the 3-D Secure authentication page for the Customer’s bank. **Good news, there is literally no extra work on your end to support it! 3D secure is fully handled by the gateway.**

The 3-D Secure authentication form is designed and controlled by the Customer’s Issuing bank and will display the Merchant Account name and any website address added when the account was onboarded. You can change the displayed name and website address by sending the `merchantName` and/or `merchantWebsite` request fields. Any `merchantWebsite` must be a fully qualified URL containing at least the scheme and host components.
You may also pass additional information about the transaction and Cardholder, using the `threeDSOptions` field. This extra information can help the Issuer decide on whether a challenge is required.

Your Merchant Account must be configured with your Merchant Category Code (MCC). This value is usually configured in the backend but can also be provided using the `merchantCategoryCode` or `threeDSOptions` request fields.

### Request Flow
 ![hosted integration Flow](../static/img/hosted-integration-flow.png)

 - **Step 1: Load the Gateway’s Hosted Form**

 Load the Hosted Form on your web page using your Gateway Integration URL. This must be loaded over HTTPS.

 - **Step 2: The Gateway Processes EMV 3-D Secure v2 Transactions**
 
 Let the Gateway handle the complexities of the 3-D Secure process for you.

 - **Step 3: Transaction Complete**

 Two ways of receiving the final transaction status response are available: via the Redirect URL and the Callback URL. Extra 3-D Secure transaction data is available in this response and can be used by your application for analytical purposes. This holds no sensitive Cardholder information.

 To use 3-D Secure on your Hosted Form, you must enable this support and fully configure your account in the backend (3-D Secure is usually enabled by default for all merchants). There should be no need for you to change your code to enable 3-D Secure support, unless you wish to use the data returned here in step 3.

### Final Response 

These fields are returned when the 3-D Secure stage has completed, and no further challenge is required.
These fields will be returned in addition to the [basic response fields](transactiontypes#transactionResponse).

## Cardholder Information
In the case of a frictionless flow, the card Issuer may sometimes wish to provide a message to the Cardholder. In this case, the `threeDSResponseMessage` will start with the text ‘Cardholder Info: ‘ and be followed by the message from the card Issuer.

## PSD2 Strong Customer Authentication
3-D Secure can be used to provide the Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) required by the European Union's Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2).
For more details on how to use 3-D Secure to maintain PSD2 SCA Compliance please refer to Refer to [SCA Using 3-D Secure](annexes#scaUsing3dSecure). 

## 3DS Options {#3dsOptions}

The following options may be sent in the `threeDSOptions` field to provide additional information to help customise the 3-D Secure experience or to help the ACS decide if a challenge is required.

Some additional information will be automatically provided by the Gateway from standard integration fields unless overridden by providing the associated option. The standard integration field associated with each option is shown in brackets below the options field name. The standard integration field should be used rather than the option, apart from the very rare circumstances where the two must have different values.

:::tip
A few additional information values, such as the Cardholder’s browser details need to be provided. for the Hosted Payment Page integration, the gateway will automatically provide those values. Passing information in the field `threeDSOptions` is fully optional.

## 3-D Secure Authentication Data {#3dSecureAuthenticationData}

The 3-D Secure system uses various data fields to report the authentication status of the Cardholder. Each 3-D Secure version may use slightly different terminology for the fields and have slightly different values but for ease of use the Gateway uses the terminology and values as described in this appendix.

The field’s values would normally be populated by the Gateway’s 3DS Server component (The 3DS Server is the Gateway/Merchant component that provides the interface with the 3DS Directory Server), however you may choose to use your own 3DS Server component and provide the values.

### 3D Secure enrolment status

The `threeDSEnrolled` field indicates if the card is enrolled in the 3-D Secure program.

The value is determined if the card number is within one of the enrolled ranges downloaded daily from the Directory Server using a Preparation Request/Response (PReq/PRes) message.

The field can contain one of the following values:

**Y – Enrolled**. The card is enrolled in the 3-D Secure program and the payer is eligible for authentication
processing.

**N - Not Enrolled**. The checked card is eligible for the 3-D Secure (it is within the card association’s range of accepted cards) but the card issuing bank does not participate in the 3-D Secure program. If the Cardholder later disputes the purchase, the issuer may not submit a chargeback to you.

**U - Unable To Verify Enrolment**. The card associations were unable to verify whether the Cardholder is registered. As the card is ineligible for 3-D Secure, you can choose to accept the card nonetheless and precede the purchase as non-authenticated and submits authorisation with ECI 07.

**E - Error Verifying Enrolment**. The Gateway encountered an error. This card is flagged as 3-D Secure ineligible. The card can be accepted for payment at your discretion.

### 3DS Authentication status

The `threeDSAuthenticated` field indicates if the cardholder has been authenticated by the 3-D Secure program.

The value is provided by the Directory Server either on requesting authentication in the Authentication Response (ARes) message, in the case of a frictionless flow, or after a Cardholder
challenge in the Result Request (RReq) message, in the case of a challenge flow.

The field can contain one of the following values:

**Y - Authentication Successful**. The Issuer has authenticated the Cardholder by verifying the identity information or password. A CAVV and an ECI of 5 is returned. The card is accepted for payment and authentication data passed to authorisation processing.

**A - Attempted Authentication**. A proof of authentication attempt was generated. The Cardholder is not participating, but the attempt to authenticate was recorded. The card can be accepted for payment at your discretion and authentication data passed to authorisation processing.

**N - Not Authenticated**. The Cardholder did not complete authentication and the card should not be accepted for payment.

**R – Rejected By Issuer**. The Issuer rejected the transaction and must not be accepted for payment.

**D – Decoupled Challenge Required**. Decoupled authentication confirmed.

**I – Information Only**. 3DS Requestor challenge preference acknowledged.

**U - Unable To Authenticate**. The authentication was not completed due to technical or another problem. A transmission error prevented authentication from completing. The card can be accepted for payment at your discretion, but no authentication data will be passed on to authorisation processing.

**E - Error Checking Authentication**. The Gateway encountered an error. The card can be accepted for payment at your discretion, but no authentication data will be passed on to authorisation processing.

### 3DS Transaction Identifier 

The `threeDSXID` field provides a unique value to identify the transaction through the 3-D Secure system.
The value is provided by the Directory Server and is a 36-character universally unique identifier (UUID) as defined in IETF RFC 4122.

### 3DS Electronic Commerce Indicator

The `threeDSECI` field indicates the security status of the transaction after the Cardholder has been authenticated or attempted authentication.

The value is provided by the Directory Server either on requesting authentication in the Authentication Response (ARes) message, in the case of a frictionless flow, or after a Cardholder challenge in the Result Request (RReq) message, in the case of a challenge flow.

The value is always present if the `threeDSAuthenticated` field has a value of Y (successful authentication), or A (attempted authentication) but can be present at other times.

The field can contain one of the following 2-digit values (the values are shown as pairs, the first value is for Visa and other Card Schemes and the second for Mastercard only):

- **05/02** - Both cardholder and card issuing bank are 3DS enabled. 3DS card authentication is successful.
- **06/01** - Either cardholder or card issuing bank is not 3DS enrolled. 3DS card authentication is unsuccessful, in sample situations as:
    - 3DS cardholder not enrolled.
    - Card issuing bank is not 3DS ready.
- **07/00** - Authentication is unsuccessful or not attempted. The card is either a non-3DS card or card issuing bank does not handle it as a 3DS transaction.

### 3DS Cardholder Authentication Verification Value

The `threeDSCAVV` field provides proof that the Cardholder has been authenticated or attempted authentication.

The value is provided by the Directory Server either on requesting authentication in the Authentication Response (ARes) message, in the case of a frictionless flow, or after a Cardholder challenge in the Result Request (RReq) message, in the case of a challenge flow.

The value is present if the `threeDSAuthenticated` field has a value of Y (successful authentication), or A (attempted authentication).

The field will contain a 28-character Base-64 encoded value (32-characters for Mastercard).
