# Introduction

The REST API Integration for ecommerce provides a method for application developers to access the Gateway’s data in order to build their own applications. Third-party applications would require in depth programming knowledge and must be PCI compliant.
If you wish to create your own merchant management system, then you would use the REST interface to access the data you wish to display.

Note: The REST interface cannot be used to submit transactions, to do this you would need to still use the Direct or Hosted integration methods.


### What you'll need

You will need the following information to integrate with Gateway’s REST interface.

|       |  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **User Account**   | Access to the REST interface requires a valid User account provided by Handpoint. This is the same user account you use to access the administration panel. You should have received these details when your account was set up.|
| **Integration URL** | https://ecommerce.example.com/rest/  (It will be provided by Handpoint).|
