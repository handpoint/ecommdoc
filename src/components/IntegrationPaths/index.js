       The hosted integration method makes it easy to add secure payment processing to your online business, using the Handpoint hosted payment page.
       You can use this method if you do not want to collect and store cardholder data and be <b>kept OUT of PCI scope</b>. The standard hosted payment page is designed to be shown
       in a lightbox over your website but can also be embedded in an iFrame.<br></br><br></br> By using the hosted payment page integration, you are <b>kept out of the EMV 3D-Secure flow</b> which allows

       With direct integration, your merchant’s website captures the card details and then forwards these to the secure Handpoint gateway. 
       Direct integration is more complex than the hosted integration methods and puts your software <b>IN PCI scope</b> as
       you will be handling card data. The benefit of this integration method is that the entire shopping process can occur within your merchants’ websites.

      The Handpoint pay by link solution allows a merchant to create a simple HTML link that can be integrated into a webpage or e-mail. When clicked, the user is taken to the hosted
      payment form with pre-populated product information such as the amount, product description and order reference. We offer the pay by link solution as a QR Code, a simple link
      or a button.
